# Mastering Tetris: AI Agent Training for Complex Decision-Making

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing AI agents capable of mastering Tetris through advanced reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. Our work explores two primary approaches: **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** and **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**, with an experimental attempt at **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.

The AI agents are trained to optimize gameplay, clear lines efficiently, and achieve high scores, showcasing complex decision-making and strategic evolution over time.

## Tetris Environment
`tetris.py`  
- Adapted from an open-source Tetris environment ([source](https://github.com/vietnh1009/Tetris-deep-Q-learning-pytorch)).  
- **Modifications**:  
  - Reward system changed to linear line-clearing rewards (original was quadratic).  
  - Enhanced state space to increase complexity and improve learning potential.  
  - Environment restructured to accommodate **population-based approaches** in GA.

## DQN Implementation
All DQN-related code is organized within the `dqn` directory and implemented in `dqn.ipynb`.

| Class/Function  | Description  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DQN`           | PyTorch neural network with three sequential layers using ReLU activation and batch normalization. Xavier initialization is applied to the weights. Two versions exist: one for 4-feature environments (size 64) and one for 8-feature environments (size 128).|
| `train`         | Implements the epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation. Utilizes experience replay and trains the model after accumulating 30,000 experiences over 3,000 games.|
| `record_game`   | Records gameplay using the trained model and outputs the video using OpenCV. |
| `evaluate_model`| Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance over multiple games, providing average scores, lines cleared, and tetrominoes survived. |

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation
All GA-related code resides in the `genetic_algorithm` directory.

| File Name              | Description  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `agent_genetic.py`     | Defines the `GeneticAgent` class, representing individual agents within the population. Agents utilize weight vectors to decide states and actions. |
| `genetic_algorithm.py` | Contains the main `GeneticAlgorithm` class. Implements crossover, mutation, and elitism for evolving populations. Key methods include `crossover()` and `mutate()`. |
| `run_genetic.py`       | Main loop for running and evolving the genetic algorithm. Tracks generation fitness and visualizes results. Saves the top-performing agent via pickle. |
| `run_best_agent.py`    | Tests the best agent after training, visualizes gameplay, and saves recordings as MP4 videos. |

## PPO (Experimental)
- **Directory**: `ppo`  
- **Description**: Initial attempt to train PPO models for Tetris, implemented in `ppo.ipynb`. Due to time constraints and limited resources, this approach remains incomplete but serves as a foundation for future exploration.
